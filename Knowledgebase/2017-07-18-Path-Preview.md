Path Preview is a viewing mode which coaches can use when they need to look ahead at the activities that will be presented to their students as a part of the team's subscription. During Path Preview viewers are able to jump into any activity that was included with their subscription and navigate forward or backward without any limitations. Their progress in the path while viewing activities also does not count towards their total path progress in the path system. They can also submit responses to questions in the text fields, but those responses are not saved.

## Launching in Path Preview Mode

Coaches can access path preview mode from the navigation menu inside their personal path. To access a preview of the path activiteis, first launch your personal path from either the main navigation menu or from your metrics page. Once you are viewing the path, open up the side menu again and click on "Path Preview." You will be taken to the path journal inside the path preview mode. From this page, you can jump into and preview any activity.

## Exiting Path Preview Mode

When you are ready to exit path preview mode, click on the link "continue path" inside the side menu. You will be taken back to your personal path.
