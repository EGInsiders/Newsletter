If a student has forgotten their password, then it is possible to reset it from their Edit Membership page.
<h2>Navigate to a student’s Edit Membership Page</h2>

Click on the option menu located to the right of a specific student’s name. This menu is available anywhere that students are listed, such as on the Metrics page, the Members page, or on the edit page for one of the groups that they belong to. Next, click on “Edit Membership.”
<h2>Changing the student’s password</h2>

Inside the student’s Edit Membership page, look for the header “Change Password.” Enter in a new password for the student, then confirm in the next field, and click “Save” at the bottom of the page.
