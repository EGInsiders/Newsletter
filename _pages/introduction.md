<p>Welcome to Glitchfork,an online testing community.</p>
<p><b>About EduGuide</b></p>
<p>EduGuide is a non profit in Lansing, Michigan, which has a mission of building a mentoring community which helps students achieve their life goals by guiding them through a series of character building online activities.</p>
<p>The organization is looking for volunteer testers who are interested in dedicating some of their free time towards reviewing the existing site, testing new features, and sharing general feedback about our platform.</p>
<p>You do not need to be a professional tester in order to participate. In fact, we are looking for people with a wide range of technical skills. You should have access to a computer, the Internet, and around five hours per week to dedicate towards testing. A lot of the testing could take one or two sessions, while other exercises might stretch over a few weeks. It is up to you to decide which exercises you can accept.</p>
<p>Click the link to register to become a tester, or contact me by clicking on the blue “Get in Touch” button located along the left hand side of the screen. I can also be contacted via email at <a href="mailto:jon@eduguide.org">jon@eduguide.org</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p></p>
