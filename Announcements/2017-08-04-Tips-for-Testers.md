Tips for Testers

There is a lot going on right now, so I wanted to share some suggestions for ways that testers can help with the testing process.

1. **Join the Podio Workspace**. I sent out invitations to Podio a few weeks ago, but if you haven't gotten one let me know via email [jon@eduguide.org](mailto:jon@eduguide.org) or respond in this documentâ€™s comments. The workspace contains lists of assignments and scenarios, as well as places to log ideas and feature change suggestions.

2. **Review Issues, Feature Changes, and Questions in the workspace.** Familiarize yourself with the lists of known issues or questions, and respond to the items that you feel the strongest about.

3. **Complete assignments.**

# Assignments

Right now the features we are focussing the most on involve team launch and team setup. There are a number of assignments which ask you to join a team as an admin coach and to complete the process of launching a team. When you're done, remember to post any questions or issues you encountered while going through that process. You can also log notes using the "Help" tab on the site, or sending email to web@eduguide.org.

Here is a general checklist of tasks that would generally help with the testing of the site:

1. Join a team as a coach, and complete the team setup page.

2. While logged in as a coach, test different areas such as the team dashboard, team goals, path, metrics page, group management, etc. Try the different functions and note any problems.

3. Run through the path. As an admin coach, there is no limit to the number of activities you can complete in one session.

4. Join a team as a student, and run through their process of getting started in the path. Log any issues.

5. Test failures such as forgetting your password, typos in your name, etc. How easy is it to correct typos or reset your password?

I am available via email or DM in Podio if you have any questions on how to get started. There is also a general discussion area in Podio where members of the workspace can post notes or questions.
