# Invitations for Podio

Starting this week, all of the discussion, assignments, and issue tracking will be handled via a tool called Podio. This will help to consolidate everything under one tool. I will be phasing out the use of Trello and Slack.

If you haven't gotten an invitation to join Podio, let me know and Iâ€™ll make sure that you get one.

The workspace inside Podio is separated into different areas which Podio refers to as "apps." These are kind of equivalent to Slack's channels. There are:

* Announcements - I will be posting news, announcements, updates here.

* Assignments - This will replace the Trello board. As I enter in the assignments I'll assign them out to members, or if you want to work on one you can add your name.

* Issues - Log all bugs under this section.

* Feature Changes - When you see something that looks a little funny but not broken, or an opportunity for improvement, add a note here.

* Ideas - If as you are using the site you think of a new feature we should add, or maybe a broader, long term improvement, add them here.

* Ask a Question - When you are not sure what to do, or why the site behaves the way it does, ask a question here.

* Documentation - I'll be adding knowledgebase articles, how-tos, and user guides here.

* Resources - Links to the rest of the tools or sites that we will be using.

* Testing Guides - I'll be posting testing scripts here.

* Events - Upcoming meetings or projects.

There is a place where you can post a comment next to items that have been posted, plus there is a kind of homepage where you can post general messages. Click on the speech bubbles over on the upper right hand corner of the screen to send someone a private chat message. If you have any questions, feel free to send me a private DM or email me at [helpdesk@gmail.com](mailto:helpdesk@gmail.com).

# Development Update

Over the weekend, the developers completed the migration to a new server.

There are a number of features which are coming close to being ready for testing. I'll post assignments as they become available. In the meanwhile, continue general testing on the live site or contact me if you have any questions on where to test.
