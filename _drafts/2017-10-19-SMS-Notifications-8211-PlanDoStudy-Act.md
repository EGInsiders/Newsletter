<h1>SMS Notifications - Plan/Do/Study Act</h1>
<p>Today during our Tactical meeting discussion we reviewed the SMS Notifications feature. SMS notifications will be primarily to college students as an alternative means of receiving path reminders and notifications. Participating students will be prompted for their mobile phone number and asked to enable the SMS notifications as they complete the activities in the path.</p>
<p>Teams which will offer SMS notifications include:</p>
<ul>
<li>UTEP</li>
<li>Davenport</li>
<li>MI GEAR UP</li>
</ul>
<p>As an alternative form of communications, SMS offers many different advantages. SMS messages are immediate and more engaging than email, so we expect to see a high response rate from students. Since SMS is a channel that is primarily accessed via mobile phones, text messages will also introduce students to the mobile version of our website, and perhaps encourage a “respond-where-you-are” mentality.</p>
<p>We hope to see the following benefits from introducing SMS notifications/reminders to students:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students will complete more activities overall as a reaction to the path reminders and comment notifications they receive via text messages</li>
<li>Feature will leverage the college student learning style and allow for responses in between classes, in the evening, etc.</li>
<li>Interaction between coaches and students will increase, once we are able to send coaches text notifications</li>
</ul>
<h1>Measurements</h1>
<p></p>
<p>We will be using the following to measure the success/failure of the SMS Notifications to create a growth in engagement among students:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Number of visits to our website via mobile devices - This should increase as students respond to the text messages.</li>
<li>Increase in Student Engagement - This would be indicated by the rate of responses, and the speed with which students complete the activities. Also, we can look at the quality of the responses. They might go up or down as the college students begin posting from their mobile devices</li>
<li>Number of students who enter their cell phone number</li>
<li>Number of students who opt into the SMS notifications feature</li>
<li>Number of students who send the command “stop” - If at least 25% of the total number of college students who have been offered the option of using the SMS notifications feature begin to opt out via the “stop” command, then we would consider this a red flag telling us that there is something wrong.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Hypothesis</h1>
<ul>
<li>Ideal - 80% join Rate</li>
<li>Return on Investment - Higher than 10 - 20%</li>
<li>50% of College students respond to at least one SMS notification, and 15% respond to more than one</li>
</ul>
<h1>Contributing Factors</h1>
<p>There are a few other factors that we should be considering as we plan for the roll out of the SMS notifications to college students:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Communication </b>- We want to make sure that we communicate clearly and take opportunities to remind students of the availability of the SMS Notifications (feature), what students need to do, when and why text messages will be sent to them, and how they can adjust their settings. We should communicate to both the coordinators and the students, but tailor the messaging differently.</li>
<li><b>User Support </b>- This holds true for the entire platform, but it would be good to have information in our knowledgebase which explains the key parts of our SMS notifications feature. College students would be able to look up this information on the fly and take action without relying on coordinators or on our live support. I think as independent students, that a knowledgebase will be far more critical than it has been for secondary schools.<ul>
<li><b>Help Channels</b> - We should be sure to describe our mechanisms for how a user can contact us when they run into difficulties on the site. Either via email, <a href="mailto:web@eduguide.org">web@eduguide.org</a>, the widget, or via Live Chat.<ul>
<li>We should be prepared to see requests for support increase as college students begin to participate on the site. Perhaps we should build in timed activities which invite questions about how the site works, because there might be a few students who encounter issues but will not report it. We could also build in surveys. Requests will also come in outside of normal school hours/business hours as students will be working on EduGuide paths in the evening and during the weekend.</li>
<li>Should we invite feedback via Twitter or Facebook? We could start a FB group and invite students to join where they can ask questions and get regular tips, etc. This would be another way to get feedback on the SMS notifications.</li>
<li>We should ask about the ways in which we can filter our information down to the individual colleges’ helpdesks or staff, so that they are able to assist college students if/when they turn to them for help. At the very least, we should offer resources that the students can be directed to.</li>
