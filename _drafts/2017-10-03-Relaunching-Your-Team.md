<h1>Relaunching Your Team</h1>
<p>Subscriptions to the Core Learning Path are for each school year. After the school year ends, your team’s path subscription will expire automatically and your team will be archived. During this archival process, the groups and students on your team will be archived and your team will be disabled.</p>
<p>When your school renews for another year, your team will be relaunched. Relaunching a team means that the path subscription is re-enabled for coaches and students, and the set up process for your team will be started over. As coaches return to the team, they will be taken to the Team Setup page where they will be asked to review certain key aspects of the team’s settings. These include requesting a new IT test and ensuring that testing has been completed successfully, removing old coaches from the list of coaches, inviting any new coaches that are needed on the team, and setting up a coaching session if needed.</p>
<h2>Getting Students Started</h2>
<p>When you relaunch your team, you will need to handle returning students a little bit differently than you would brand-new students. In either case, however, you will want to start a new group.</p>
<h3>Creating a New Group</h3>
<p>From the Groups page, click on “Create Group.” A field for your new group name will appear. Enter in a group name and then click “Save.” A new group will appear under the “Pending” category on the page.</p>
<p>Next, click on “Invite Members” in order to be taken to the group’s invitation code page. On that page, you can copy the join code to your clipboard.</p>
<p>When your students are ready to get started, instruct them to go to http://join.eduguide.org and follow the instructions on the screen.</p>
<h4>Adding New Students</h4>
<h5>New students</h5>
<p>Students who are new to the site will want to click “No, Join.” This will take them to a registration form where they will be prompted to enter in their information. In the field labeled “Join Code,” they should enter in the code for your group.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Returning Students</p>
<p></p>
<p>Returning students will want to click “Login,” and then enter in the email address and password for their accounts. They are not required to enter in a join code at this point. After they log in, they will be prompted for a group code. They will need to enter in the code for your new group into this field. After they submit it, they will be added to your new group.</p>
<h2>Managing Archived Groups</h2>
<p>After groups have been archived, you can view a list of them by clicking on “Archived Groups” on the groups page. There is also a link labeled “Archived Members” which will take you to a view of members who have been archived.</p>
<p>You can archive and unarchive groups from their edit page, which is accessible by clicking on the groups’ names in the Groups page. Members are automatically unarchived when they join an active group, such as a group which was recently created. Students retain their membership in archived groups unless they are manually removed.</p>
