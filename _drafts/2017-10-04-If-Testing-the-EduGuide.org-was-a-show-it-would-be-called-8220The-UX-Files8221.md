<p>If I had to give just one reason for starting a volunteer testing group, I would say that it is because I have a lot of questions. We’ve been developing this version of the website for about four years, and many of its features have also gone through their own iterations or major redesigns in that same time span. But, one thing that we’re still trying to figure out is how well they work for users. We know that they <b>do</b> work, because we see results. We need to go deeper, and learn how people feel about the different parts of our website.</p>
<p>There are too many questions to solve for for me to cover everyone with a testing exercise. So, I thought I would run through a few of the bigger ones and then get everybody’s thoughts. Your interest level will help to determine how we will focus our attention. Or, maybe we break up into smaller groups, like task forces, and take on different tests.</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Onboarding. </b>One of the biggest challenges for our onboarding is that there are so many types of accounts and so many scenarios that we need to accommodate. We have onboarding for coaches, members, and restricted members (students). Then, we have the scenario where we invited the first coach to come and configure their team, and then they send invitations to the people who they want to participate on their team as different levels of coaches. Those levels of coaches are admin coach, lead coach, and support coach. We also have onboarding for joining a Demo Team which is slightly different than these other scenarios. Some of this process can be tested right now by joining the EduGuide Insiders team on EduGuide.org. The exercise is in the Trello Community.</li>
<li><b>Getting Started.</b> This is technically a part of onboarding, and follows along with the scenarios that I described above, but is just as perplexing. There are two main flows: Students are taken into their paths as soon as they join the site. They have a very limited access to the tools on the site, so mostly they can only work on their path or adjust their personal settings. Coaches have access to teams, their profile, personal settings, the Metrics page, groups, members, and (if they are admin coaches) the coaches list. But, focussing on just the coaches, we tend to lose people after they’ve joined the team and started to work on their path or begin tracking their students on the path. There is commonly a lull between when teachers (coaches) join the team, and when their students join. It is kind of a question of “now what,” for which I’m not sure we have a good answer. There is a lot that they can do, but it is hard to give them adequate direction.</li>
<li><b>Group Management and AutoGroups</b>. There is a function called “Autogroups” which coaches can turn on or off on their team. When is on, groups are created automatically for coaches as they join the team. The groups will be named after the person joining. For example, if my name was John Smith, the title of the group that’s created for me would be “John Smith’s Group.”</li>
<li><b>Getting Students Started.</b> This is one aspect of the site we’ve made a lot of improvements on, but is still a struggle for some coaches. We have built in pages which assist with this process such as the group management page, the page which displays the join code information, and the members management page. I think that what we need to learn the most is how these pages align with the teachers’ needs out in the real world.</li>
<li><b>Paths.</b> People tend to like our path activities; they are the center of our entire platform. I would be interested in getting feedback on the activities on both the content and the technical level. As we add new activities, it would be great to have a few additional eyes to help go through the activities and point out ways in which we can improve.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>Those are the first few topics that I would like to see solved for on the site. Let me know which of these you’d like to see taken on. I’ve added these topics to our Trello Community as cards. I am also available by chat via the green chat tab on the EduGuide Insiders team. Or, respond to this document directly in the comments.</p>
