<p>If you are a student who will be joining the EduGuide website, you will be provided a join code or URL by your teacher which you can use when you register a new account. Depending on which method your teacher chooses, you will either be asked to enter or click a URL, or you will be asked to go to http://join.eduguide.org and enter in a numerical code.</p>
<p>During the registration process, you will be asked for your first and last name, your email address, and a password. It is important that you are careful when you enter in your email address and password, because this is the information that you will need when you log back into your account.</p>
<p>After you register you will be prompted for your custom avatar and then taken into your first activity.</p>
