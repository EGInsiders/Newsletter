<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Class Activity: Science of Character</b></p>
<p>Directions: Use the video, Science of Character, from the website Let It Ripple and this document as a guide to lead students through an introduction to the EduGuide program. Pair it with About EduGuide, so students have clear expectations and are ready to begin.</p>
<p><b>Link to Film: Science of Character</b></p>
<p>http://www.eduguide.org/video/view/51</p>
<p>Students will examine various elements and areas of character study, as well as ways in which learning these key Core Learning Skills helps us to not only achieve personal academic goals, but also helps later on in life with career and relationships. Identifying ways character strengths create an integrated identity and ultimately relationships. Further the discussion by watching the video together and sharing in a group discussion. Review these concepts at the start of the program to get the conversation going and give students a better idea of what they will be working on this year through their own personal path of exploration, online with EduGuide.</p>
