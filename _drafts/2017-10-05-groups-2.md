Team members can use the Goals feature to work together on a set list of goals. When a team member chooses to work on a given goal, they can “adopt” it from the team goal page. Team goals can be accessed by clicking on “Goals” in the team main navigation.
<h2>Adopting A goal</h2>
From the team goal page, click on the “Adopt” button next to the goal’s title. You will be taken to a series of pages where you can personalize the goal. Once you are down, you will be taken to the goal’s detail page, where you can see a list of other members who have also adopted it. You can also post messages on the goal’s dashboard.
