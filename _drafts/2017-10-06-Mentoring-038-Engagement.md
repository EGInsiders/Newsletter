<p>Online Mentoring: Team Coaches will be communicating with you through the reflective writing exercises in the Core Learning Path. They are there to support you on your path to growth. When Team Coaches respond to your comments, you will be notified on the first screen you see when you log back on to EduGuide the next time. That is the time to answer their questions and ask them questions in return to continue the conversation.</p>
<p>Notifications: You will also be notified of Team Coach responses to your comments when by email. You can choose to reply via email or simply respond the next time you log on.</p>
<p>Online Dialogue: Engage in conversation with your Team Coaches by applying best practices for mentoring others. Support Team Coaches in their role by asking them questions about their own development. Take the time to participate in the conversation.</p>
<h2>Mentoring Principles</h2>
<p>Ask open-ended questions. Most prompts from Team Coaches may be questions. Questions ignite critical thinking skills and help us search for answers. Questions broaden the impact of the activity and spark reflection over time. They also prompt us to dig deeper and clarify our ideas, so we become better readers, writers, and thinkers.</p>
<p>Get personal. Understanding one another’s situation, experiences, and knowledge builds trust. Being able to appreciate one another’s experiences gives us a solid foundation for learning. Some prompts may be as simple as “Can you tell me more”. Take the time to dig into the work of sharing with one another. This is one of the ways we grow our strengths.</p>
<p>Focus on the activity, not grammar. For these activities, grow more by approaching the exercises as free writing, rather than freezing or making corrections. Type what you think and feel to gain a better understanding about ourselves, others, and the world. You can always go back to the activity at a later point in time and revise it into a composition.</p>
<p>Practice effective encouragement. Be sure we are focused on praising one another’s efforts rather than talents. Much of our success comes through hard work. Focusing on ways we can tap into our strengths to keep getting better is more important than just concentrating on sheer skill or other natural talents. </p>
<p>Be supportive. Growth involves wrestling with emotional setbacks; sometimes we all need a little validation of our feelings and to know someone cares. Show support by responding to posts. This is a great chance to help someone. Practice being a leader.</p>
<h2>Engaging in Dialogue</h2>
<p>Could you tell me more about...?</p>
<p>I’m not sure I understand what you are saying. Please tell me more.</p>
<p>Could you give me another example of what you’re saying?</p>
<p>When you said... what did you mean?</p>
<p>Could you give me more details about that?</p>
<p>How did... happen?</p>
<p>Did you expect... to happen?</p>
<p>Why do you think... happened?</p>
<p>What made you do/feel/say/think that?</p>
<p>What did you do/feel/say/think when... happened?</p>
<p>That must be difficult. I’m sorry to hear about this.</p>
<p>It sounds as though this must have made you upset.</p>
