<p>Autogroups is a feature on the site which, when enabled, will automatically create a new group for the lead coaches who are invited to join the team. When Autogroup is turned on, a new group is created for each lead coach as an invitation is going out. Initially, the pending lead coach’s email address is displayed as the group’s name. When the lead coach joins the site, the group’s title is changed so that it contains their full name.</p>
<p>Admin and lead coaches can also create groups manually as they need them.</p>
<h2>Managing the Autogroups Feature</h2>
<p>Admin coaches are given the chance to customize the autogroups feature during the team set up process. If they need to make adjustments later, they can do so from the team setup page or from the Groups management page.</p>

<h2>Groups while the Autogroups feature is turned off</h2>
<p>When the autogroups feature is turned off, admin coaches will need to create every group and assign coaches manually.</p>
