<p>Team members can use the Goals feature to work together on a set list of goals. When a team member chooses to work on a given goal, they can “adopt” it from the team goal page. Team goals can be accessed by clicking on “Goals” in the team main navigation.</p>
<h2>Adopting A goal</h2>
<p>From the team goal page, click on the “Adopt” button next to the goal’s title. You will be taken to a series of pages where you can personalize the goal. Once you are down, you will be taken to the goal’s detail page, where you can see a list of other members who have also adopted it. You can also post messages on the goal’s dashboard.</p>
<p></p>
<p># Adopt a Read Only Goal</p>
<p></p>
<p>Given that I am on the team goal page</p>
<p>And the goal I adopt is read only for members</p>
<p>When I click on “Adopt”</p>
<p>Then I am taken to the goal’s detail page</p>
<p>And I’ve adopted the goal</p>
<p></p>
<p>#Adopt a Goal with Default Settings</p>
<p></p>
<p>Given that I am on the team goal page</p>
<p>And I adopt a goal with default edit settings</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I click “Adopt”</p>
<p>Then I am taken to the Adopt a Goal flow</p>
<p></p>
<p>## Enter Goal Information</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I leave the Start Date set at the default date</p>
<p>And the Due Date set at the default date</p>
<p>And click “Next”</p>
<p>Then I am taken to the “Edit Steps” page</p>
<p></p>
<p>## Edit Steps</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I click “add step”</p>
<p>Then the “Edit Step” form appears</p>
<p></p>
<p>## Create a Step</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I enter a Step Name</p>
<p>And Step Notes</p>
<p>And set a Start Date</p>
<p>And set a Due Date</p>
<p>And enable Reminders</p>
<p>And click “Done”</p>
<p>Then my step is saved</p>
<p>And is displayed on the list of steps</p>
<p></p>
<p>## Create Goal</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I click “Finish”</p>
<p>Then my goal is created</p>
<p>And I am taken to the goal’s detail page</p>
<p>And the system responds, “You have adopted the goal”</p>
