<h2>Q: How do I add students and coaches to my team?</h2>
<h3>A:</h3>
<p>One thing that is always important to remember is that invitations to coaches are email based and are sent from the team setup page and that the process of inviting a student is web-based and relates to groups.</p>
<p>Inside your team, when you want to invite coaches you would click on “Team Setup,” and then within the page you would send invites to the people who you want to serve as coaches. There are three types of coaches: Admin, lead, and support. Each level of coach has a different amount of access to moderation functionality on the team. Admins would have the most, support coaches would have the least.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The process for coaches is that they either land on this page or they navigate to the page and then invite their colleagues to the team. A person’s coach type is selected at the moment that they are invited to join the team.</p>
<p>Once coaches are on the team, they can create a group on the “Groups” page. To do so, click “Groups” in the navigation, then click on “New Group” at the top of the page. You can enter in a group title and then click save.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The button “Invite Members” is displayed next to the name of each group on the “Groups” page. Click this button to be taken to the page where you can grab the join code or URL for that group. A third option is to add existing members to that group manually.</p>
