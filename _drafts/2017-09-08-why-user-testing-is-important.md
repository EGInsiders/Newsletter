<h1>Why User Testing is important</h1>
<h2>September 8, 2017</h2>
As of this November, I will have been with EduGuide for ten years. For me, this is quite an accomplishment. Before EduGuide, I had worked at a number of places where things never seemed to work out. I was laid off twice, and with the third job things didn’t work out. By the time I accepted the position at EduGuide, I was battered, bruised and, since my unemployment had just run out, very close to broke.

It was during the first few weeks working for EduGuide that I was sent to my very first World Usability Day at MSU. Up until then, I didn’t know a lot about usability, other than that when you’re building a website you want it to work well, look good, and that users should find it to be easy to use. I had no idea that there was so much depth, or that professions were based around it. In fact, MSU had (and still does) an entire lab dedicated around usability.

As I listened to the lectures which were given during World Usability, there were a lot of new concepts which began to click in my brain. At my previous job with Dow Chemical, I had been involved in supporting their world wide network of video conference rooms, which we called iRooms. Each conference room was equipped with a smart board, VCR, DVD player, document camera, and computer. The entire system was screen based. But, the technology never really seemed to take off. Was it because people hated meetings? Did they prefer meeting face-to-face despite the required travel time? WUD made me realize that perhaps something else had gone wrong: The iRooms were never really that usable. They had all of the components, but a lot of shortcomings. I remember, for example, that there were often questions about being able to show video and the computer screen at the same time. This just wasn’t possible on that system.

The biggest weakness of the iRooms was that if the computers failed, then none of the equipment could be accessed. And, over time the computers proved to be unreliable.

It’s been my goal since then to launch a user testing campaign which might help bolster our design planning and development process. I’ve made several attempts over the years but was unsuccessful either due to schedule conflicts, or other projects that took a higher priority. But, I know more than ever that today we need to deepen our user research if we want to be able to build a stronger platform that people can use.

I’m eager to hear from everybody who has joined the EduGuide Insider testing group what they want to contribute to the mission of building a user friendly platform. I’m also hoping to grow our group.
