<h2>Introducing myself</h2>
<p>My name is Jon Morgan, and I'm the Web Services Manager for EduGuide. I've served different roles during the seven years that I've been with the organization. I started as a community manager, and then my position evolved as I took on responsibilities related to project management and bug tracking. Currently, I am in charge of bug tracking, quality assurance testing, usability research, and user support.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the side, I'm interested in writing, photography, and technology in general. I'm a father of three. Next year our oldest, Kayla, will graduate from high school and our second oldest, Josh, will be a high school freshman. Our youngest, Elijah, will also be starting preschool in the Fall, so next year will be filled with lots of transitions.</p>
<h2>Introducing the Coaches Forum</h2>
<p>I started the Coaches Forum because I wanted to create an open channel for two-way communication with the coaches who support a team on our site. I am planning on sharing tips, user tutorials, FAQs, and other resources on the group. I'll be asking for feedback on the materials that I share as well as the features themselves. I'm open to suggestions on what areas I should focus on the most or if there are parts of the site that you're having difficulties with I will work hard to try to help.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You're welcome to share a quick suggestion, note, or questions any time. You can post by email by sending your message to <a href="mailto:egcoachforum@googlegroups.com">egcoachforum@googlegroups.com</a> or post on the web by going to https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/egcoachforum.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you have critical questions or issues, they can still be sent to <a href="mailto:web@eduguide.org">web@eduguide.org</a> or posted via our widget on the site. If you’re not sure and something does seem critical I will respond to a post in the forum by opening a ticket on your behalf.</p>
