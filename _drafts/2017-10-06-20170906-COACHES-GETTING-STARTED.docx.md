<p><b>Session 1</i></s></b></u></p>
<ol>
<li>Review the About EduGuide document as a class.</i></s></b></u></li>
<li>Explain that the Core Learning Path is a personal space, meaning no other students can read what they are writing.</i></s></b></u></li>

<li>Students share a goal or their vision statement by clicking below their name on My Pages.</li>
<li>Have students write down the email they use & the passwords created, so they will have an easy time logging back in when returning to their Core Learning Path.</i></s></b></u></li>
<li>If they lose this information, the Team Coach can reset the password online too.</i></s></b></u></li>
<li>Students start their first activity in the Core Learning Path called, Your Path to Growth.</i></s></b></u></li>
<li>If you would like to include a class activity on the first day, have students stop once the survey is completed. Otherwise they can continue with their online work.</i></s></b></u></li>

</ul>
<p><b>Session 3</i></s></b></u></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>PAGE_BREAK: PageBreakCoaching Principles & Prompts</b></p>
<p>Coaching students’ writing on EduGuide can build a bond of trust as you support learners in their growth. Students are notified of your responses and can choose to reply via email or the next time they login. Here are a few suggested principles and prompts to get you going.</i></s></b></u></p>
<p><b>Principles</i></s></b></u></p>
<p>Ask open-ended questions. Most prompts should be questions. Questions ignite critical thinking skills as students search for answers, even if they don’t reply. Questions broaden the impact of the activity and spark reflection over time. They also prompt reluctant writers to dig deeper and clarify their own ideas, which in turn supports the English Language Arts curriculum.</i></s></b></u></p>
<p>Be personal. Prompts can be as simple as “Can you tell me more,” but you’ll have more fun and so will your students when you make your coaching personal. This builds trust for learning.</i></s></b></u></p>
<p>Focus students on the activity, not their grammar. For these activities, students grow more when they are prompted to do more free writing, rather than being directed to go back and make corrections. EduGuide writing can be used later to build compositions.  </i></s></b></u></p>
<p>Praise effort, not talent. Telling someone they’re smart can put them in a fixed mindset, afraid to take risks that might make them look dumb. Instead of saying, “you’re a great writer,” try, “I like the work you put into your answer. Really made me think. Keep at it, and you’ll go far.”</i></s></b></u></p>
<p>Be supportive. Growth involves wrestling with emotional setbacks; sometimes all a student needs is validation of their feelings and to know someone cares. Show support by responding to students’ posts. If a particular student needs more help, this is a great chance to get it for them.  </i></s></b></u></p>
<p><b>Prompts</i></s></b></u></p>
<p>Could you tell me more about...?  
I’m not sure I understand what you are saying. Please tell me more.
Could you give me another example of what you’re saying?
When you said... what did you mean?
Could you give me more details about that?
How did... happen?
Did you expect... to happen?
Why do you think... happened? 
What stood out to you about this video?
What made you do/feel/say/think that?
What did you do/feel/say/think when... happened?
How big a priority is changing this for you: from a low of 1 to a high of 10?
What would make this a higher priority for you?
That must be difficult. I’m sorry to hear about this.
It sounds as though this must have made you upset.
Let me know if you would like to talk about that more.</i></s></b></u></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">PAGE_BREAK: PageBreakTeam Library</i></s></u></p>
<p><b>Blended Learning Options</i></s></b></u></p>
<p>EduGuide’s online student activities and your coaching responses are the program’s foundation. As time allows, you can add more impact by adding these blended learning options.</i></s></b></u></p>
<p>Explore. Students can do a variety of short and longer projects, on their own or in small groups, after completing the online activities.</i></s></b></u></p>
<ul>
<li>Provide an EduGuide mind map to make connections between the activities and their lives.</i></s></b></u></li>
<li>Invite them to interview each other about what they learned.</i></s></b></u></li>
<li>Ask them to write a brief letter helping a person or literary character who could  benefit from understanding the point of the activity.</i></s></b></u></li>
<li>Challenge students to create a speech, video or poster that helps others understand what they’ve learned.</i></s></b></u></li>

<p style="text-align: center;">PAGE_BREAK: PageBreakEduGuide Platform: Main Menu</i></s></u></p>
<p>Once you are in the EduGuide platform, access the Main Menu by clicking the 3 gray lines in the upper left. The Main Menu provides Team Coaches with additional tools to support student learning online.</i></s></b></u></p>
<p><b>Path</i></s></b></u></p>
<p>The activities are located in the Core Learning Path. Go here to enter your Coaches’ Core Learning Path. This path is the exact same Core Learning Path as the students, except there is an Orientation Activity and Tips & Tools for Team Coaches to support learning.</i></s></b></u></p>
<p><b>Team Name (This space is not accessible to students)</i></s></b></u></p>
<p>Click on the team name to access the following features listed blow. </i></s></b></u></p>

<p>Setup (Only accessible to Team Captains & Admin Coaches)</i></s></b></u></p>

<p>3 Confirm Auto-Grouping</i></s></b></u></p>
<p>EduGuide "Groups" make it easier to track students. When students join, they simply enter a group code to be placed in their coach’s group.</i></s></b></u></p>
<p>Autogroups ON</i></s></b></u></p>
<p>ON is recommended for most teams. Coaches quickly create their own groups and invite members to get started.</i></s></b></u></p>
<p>Autogroups OFF</i></s></b></u></p>
<p>OFF is better IF you need a custom group structure and don’t want to leave it to coaches to create their own. IF OFF, Admin Coaches like yourself must take the responsibility to create groups and assign all coaches. If turning OFF you may want to review our <a href="https://eduguide.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/3000062841-group-planning">help materials on planning groups</a>.</i></s></b></u></p>
