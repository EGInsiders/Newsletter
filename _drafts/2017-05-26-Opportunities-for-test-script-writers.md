<p>I am starting a new sub-group of the EduGuide Insiders which would be dedicated to the task of writing testing scripts. I see this as a different opportunity for someone to test the site, because you need to be familiar with a feature before you can write down the steps you take when you complete certain processes. But, instead of looking for problems or issues, you would be helping to explain how the site works. Your scripts will then be shared with the greater group, and they would follow them as they’re running their tests.</p>
<p>The testing scripts are so important, I feel like they lay the foundation for a lot of other potential accomplishments. Other than using them for testing, I am planning on adapting the scripts for knowledgebase articles, turning them into step-by-step user guides, and following them when we produce video tutorials for different features.</p>
<p>I’ve read that a few of you have some experience with testing, so I thought that perhaps test writing might be something that you’ve tackled before. I know that this is a volunteer role, and want to be respectful of both your time and your skill. But, it would be really helpful to have some assistance with capturing down some of these testing steps.</p>
<p>If you haven’t done this before but want to give it a try, that’s okay too. Like I said, this will really be a process of completing a process on the site--like starting a new account--and then writing down the steps. I typically use a specific style, but you can use any method that you choose as you get started.</p>
<p>One additional plus is that as you write down the scripts, I’m sure there will be things that don’t make sense to you, or maybe you can think of alternative solutions. So, we may make some new discoveries.</p>
<p>I’m going to start a Github repository where we will store the testing scripts. Anybody who is interested can join the team or fork a copy of the repository. Then, I’ll assign scripting tasks out via the Github’s Issues area. You would run through a portion of a feature, writing down the steps that you took and submit it as a code change in the repository. The scripts are going to be written in markdown.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We will also track issues in Github, or mark scripting tasks as blocked if you run into an issue. I’ll work with our developers to resolve these issues so the work can continue.</p>

Or, if you have questions feel free to email me directly at <a href="mailto:helpdesk@eduguide.org">helpdesk@eduguide.org</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’ll post head’s up about test writing assignments in the Google Group and on the community, but Github will be the go-to place for the postings.</p>
