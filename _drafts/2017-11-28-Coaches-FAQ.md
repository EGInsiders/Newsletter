<h2>Q: What if we’re not sure how to respond to a student?</h2>
<p>EduGuide has provided a list of suggested responses in the online library that you’re welcome to use, but please don’t feel the need to respond to everything students write; students are doing this as a journaling exercise with just occasional responses from their coaches. Also keep in mind that coaches can’t solve students’ problems for them, our role is simply to provide encouragement and a question that helps students reflect, such as: “Good point, why do you think that is?” If a student does share something sensitive, treat it the same way you would if that were shared in any other student writing.</p>
<h2>Q: How much time will this take? </h2>
<p>Not much. In 15 minute increments, EduGuide builds regular habits for reflection and relationship building. While students can complete an activity in 15 minutes, it’s OK if they don’t. The primary goal is to regularly bring them back each week to the mindsets, habits and skills to reach their goals. Likewise, after the first week, it’s OK if coaches can’t respond to every student each week. 15 minutes is enough to build bonds. If you have more time that’s great. EduGuide even has offline discussion guides and other resources you can use. But the most important thing is to build these regular habits with at least 15 minutes.</p>
<h2>Q: How can EduGuide actually save me time?</h2>
<p>Academic behaviors: Listening better, completing more work, participating more: that’s good for students and for staff….Engaging students to help student support: positive cycle that’s good for everyone...Narrowing gaps, including low literacy...Doing double duty by addressing ELA standards. And, of course most fundamentally, EduGuide saves you time by providing ready-made, evidence-based, no-prep activities that students can do on their own -- helping you grow stronger students in less time.</p>
