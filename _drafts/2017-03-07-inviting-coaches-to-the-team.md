After a team is launched, admin coaches are able to invite additional coaches to the team from the Coaches page.

You can navigate to the Coaches page by clicking on the gear icon located next to the Library in the blue navigational toolbar below the title of the team, then “Coaches.” Inside the Manage Team Coaches page you will see a list of coaches who have accepted their invitations, and any coaches who are still pending. Enter the email address for the person who you would like to invite, then select their coach role.’ To find out more information about these roles click the “?” image. Click on the role title for further information about the goals and responsibilities of each role. Next, click “Send Invite.” A window will appear prompting you for an optional custom message before your invitation is sent. If you need to edit or make changes to an email invitation, click on “Manage” above the Team Coaches’ names and emails (see ‘Removing Coaches’ below for more information).

The team invitation will contain a brief message and a button to connect recipients to the site where they can begin the EduGuide account creation process. They will be prompted for their registration information,then taken into their path.

<h2>Managing Coaches</h2>
You can monitor incoming coaches’ progress from the Coaches page. A coach’s email address will be replaced with their name after they join the team.
<h3>Removing Coaches</h3>
You can remove coaches by first clicking on the “Manage” link displayed next to the header in the “User” column on the page. After you’ve changed modes, an “x” will appear next to each coach’s name in the list. Click the “x” next to any coach who you would like to remove. Click “done” when you are finished.
<h3>Promoting/Demoting Coaches</h3>
You can also promote and demote coaches from the Manage Coaches page. Change a coach’s role by adjusting the radio button selection to the right of their name. You can also enable or disable the star icon if you would like to promote them to the role of Team Captain.
