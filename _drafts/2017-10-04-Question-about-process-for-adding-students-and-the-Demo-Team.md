<p>This forum is intended to help team coaches, but there will be lots of ways in which it might help us to get a better understanding of how well certain parts of our website work for our members. For example, students will sometimes join our Demo Team by mistake, and we're trying to figure out how it happens. There is a button labeled "Demo" on the homepage, and we know that information for our demo team appears in the Google search results (we are currently working on getting this changed). We also know that some students will search for EduGuide in Google instead of entering the entire join URL of http://join.eduguide.org.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As coaches who have received communication from EduGuide as you've launched your team and gotten your students started, I was wondering if there was anything we sent you which perhaps wasn't clear about how students should join your team? Have you noticed students who click the "Demo" button on our homepage?</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a teacher, do you have any advice as to the best way for us to dissuade students from clicking the links for our Demo Team?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p></p>
