<p>Every time you log back on to EduGuide, the Core Learning Path will open back up on the last activity where you were last working. From here, you can access the Path Menu by clicking the 3 gray lines in the upper left corner to navigate around the site. The Path Menu, listed below, has additional features to get more out of your learning experience.</p>
<p>Path Journal</p>
<ul>
<li>The Path Journal is an archive of all of the work done in your Core Learning Path on the platform. This includes comments you make within your activities and the responses or online conversations you have with Team Coaches who mentor you.</li>
<li>You can go back in the Core Learning Path by using this tool to add to what you have already shared at an earlier point in time. It is useful for deeper reflection and to push thinking further. </li>
</ul>
<p>My Glossary</p>
<ul>
<li>As you complete the Core Learning Path, you can click on any word to find the definition and translate different terms. </li>
<li>These words are then saved to a glossary tool.</li>
<li>Click on ‘My Glossary’ to go back to review the definitions of words you have selected throughout your work on the Core Learning Path.</li>
</ul>
<p>Group Code</p>
<p>This feature is available for you to quickly be added to additional Team Coach groups, so you can have multiple Team Coaches supporting your learning and mentoring you online. Simply add the 7-digit invitation code given to you by a Team Coach to be added to their group. </p>
<p>Personal Dashboard</p>
<p>Click here to return to your personal space on EduGuide. It will take you back to the My Pages described above under the Main Menu features.</p>
<p>Help & Feedback</p>
<p>You should use this feature as a way to reach out to EduGuide whenever you need technical or support or assistance in completion of the program.</p>
