<p>Normally, it is only possible to view activity content sequentially as you are working on it. But, it is possible for coaches to view all of the activities which are included in their subscription by using the path preview feature.</p>
<h2>Accessing Path Preview</h2>

<p>After you launch your path, open up the main navigation menu on the left hand side, and then click “Path Preview.” This will take you to a different version of the path journal which shows you all of the activities in your path subscription. Click on the title of an activity or an activity step in order to jump to it in the path.</p>

<h2>Navigating Activities in Path Preview</h2>

<p>You will see many of the same controls in the Preview mode as you would when you are completing the path. The left and right arrows on the right hand side allow you to advance from step to step, and the menu control gives you access to the same main navigation.</p>
<p>There are also some critical differences between preview mode and the standard view. While you are previewing the activities in the path, you are able to post comments, but your responses aren’t saved. Your progress in the path is also not recorded. Path preview should only be used to review the content presented in the activities in preparation for guiding students. When you want to complete activities for yourself, you should do so in the standard view.</p>
<h2>Exiting Path Preview Mode</h2>
<p>When you are ready to exit the path preview mode, open up the main navigation and then click on “Continue Path.” You will be taken back to the step you are currently working on in the path.</p>
