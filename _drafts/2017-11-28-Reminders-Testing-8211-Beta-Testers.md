<h1>Reminders Testing</h1>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p></p>
<p>EduGuide will be releasing an update to its website which will allow us to send a series of reminders to our members. For example, as coaches are invited to the team they will receive the invitation email, and then a series of follow up emails if they do not join right away. There are other notifications that we will be sending out which are designed to motivate users to take specific steps.</p>
<h1>Scenario</h1>
<p>You are going to be invited to join the <b>Degrassi Junior High team</b> as a coach on the staging site. Since we’re testing the reminder notification, you can choose whether or not to join right away or to wait. The notifications you receive will be determined by the steps that you complete.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For reference, this team can be viewed with the URL https://staging.eduguide.org/team/899/coaches/dashboard . </p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>After you register as a tester, your email address will be added to the whitelist on our staging site so that you can receive notifications. I’ll also invite you to join the team. Watch for the notifications to arrive, and the respond with feedback.</p>
<h2>Criteria for Assessment</h2>
<p>As you receive the notifications, try to assess them for the following:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Content.<ul>
<li>Is it clear what each message is asking you to do?</li>
<li>Are there any irregularities in the text?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Engagement<ul>
<li>Do the messages feel motivational?</li>
<li>Are the messages sent frequently enough without feeling overwhelming?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Technical Issues</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Share feedback by posting it inside the <a href="http://eduguide.freshdesk.com/support/discussions/3000000320">Fall Development 2017 Forum</a> on our Freshdesk site. You will need to log in before you can post, because the forum is accessible to only EduGuide staff. Or, you can email feedback to <a href="mailto:web@eduguide.org">web@eduguide.org</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Participants can also join a <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/group/RR0HltHG2dykkIGf2">live chat on Google Hangouts</a> where you can share suggestions or questions.</p>
