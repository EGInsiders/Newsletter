<h1>Getting in touch with EduGuide</h1>
<p></p>
<p>When you have a question, suggestion, or an issue you’ve run into on the website that you would like to report, there are many ways in which you can communicate with EduGuide’s support staff.</p>
<h2>Open a ticket</h2>
<p>You can open up a support ticket by sending an email to <a href="mailto:web@eduguide.org">web@eduguide.org</a> or clicking on the “Help” tab on the left hand side of the screen, or clicking on the “Help & Feedback” link in the main navigation.</p>
<h2>Live Chat</h2>
<p>While you are on the site, if you get stuck or have a question, see if our “Chat with us” feature is on. When someone is available, the link “Chat with us” will appear in the main navigation. Clicking on the link will open a chat window with our support staff.</p>
<h2>User Forums</h2>
