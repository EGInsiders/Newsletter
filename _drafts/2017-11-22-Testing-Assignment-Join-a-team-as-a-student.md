<p>I am looking for volunteers who are available to join a team on our staging site and complete one or two activities inside our path system. As a student, you will be prompted to join a team on our site, and then directed into your first activity in the path. The activities only take a few minutes to complete. You will be able to complete five activities during each session, so you can complete all of them or break them up into separate sessions.</p>
<h2>Joining this Exercise</h2>
<p>You can use the URL below to join the team.</p>
<h2>Sharing Feedback</h2>
<p>Share feedback via the “Help” tab, the “Help & Feedback” link in the main navigation, or by sending email to <a href="mailto:web@eduguide.org">web@eduguide.org</a>.</p>
