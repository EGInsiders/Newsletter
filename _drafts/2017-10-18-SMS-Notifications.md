<p>I am looking for feedback on SMS Notifications. Students can subscribe to SMS notifications when they join a team by opting in and entering their cell phone number. They can also edit their SMS notification settings from their My Settings page.</p>
<p>SMS Notifications are enabled for the EduGuide Insiders team on the live site, so I was wondering if any testers have been getting them. Do you recall being prompted to opt into the SMS notifications when you joined the team? Have you found them to be helpful?</p>
<p>Contact me at <a href="mailto:jon@eduguide.org">jon@eduguide.org</a> with feedback. If you would like to try this feature out and then share feedback, you can enable SMS notifications in your settings page. Only students will receive SMS notifications.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, just let me know.</p>
