<h2>Create a Group</h2>

<h2>Copy the Group Join Code</h2>

<p></p>
<p>Copy either the join code or the join URL by clicking on the “copy” button. You can also view a full list of group members by clicking on “view list” while you’re on the group’s join code page.</p>
<h3>Distribute the Join code to students</h3>
<p></p>
<p>On the day that you launch the team, share either the URL or the Code with students via email, a handout, or a webpage.</p>
<h2>Ask Students to Join</h2>
<p>Instruct students to join the site by navigating to http://join.eduguide.org and then entering in the join code as they register. Or, if they use the join URL they will automatically be taken to a registration form. After they submit their registration information, they will be confirmed as members of your team and added to your group.</p>
<h2>Student Paths</h2>
<p>Your students’ paths will launch immediately after they join your team. The first activity they work on will ask them to complete a survey and introduce them to the path feature.</p>
