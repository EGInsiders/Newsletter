<h1>Changes in User Testing Techniques</h1>
<p></p>
<p>I wanted to let everyone know that I am adjusting some of the process for conducting user testing. Most recently, I had switched to Podio for our communication and bug tracking, but as that was getting going EduGuide was in the midst of purchasing a full license for Freshdesk. This license offered us the ability to host forums inside our support system. And, since our support system ties into another online tool that we use to communicate changes to our web development team, it made a lot of sense to just post suggested changes and bugs there. I had thought about just using both Podio and Freshdesk, but I couldn’t find a way to do this practically.</p>
<p>So, I am pulling back on our communication tools with the exception of Freshdesk. We could use the Google plus community for general communication, and then the Freshdesk forums for reporting issues or questions. I’m still working through some of this.</p>
<h2>Using the Freshdesk Forum</h2>
<p>The EduGuide Insider forum will only show up if you are given access to it. So, go ahead and join our support site at http://eduguide.freshdesk.com then send me an email and I will make the necessary adjustment to your account. After that, you will be able to post questions, issues, and suggestions inside our forum.</p>
