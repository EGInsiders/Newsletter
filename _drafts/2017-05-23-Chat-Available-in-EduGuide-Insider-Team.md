<p>There is now a chat feature available only to members of the <i>EduGuide Insiders</i> team on EduGuide.org. When you log in and navigate to the team’s dashboard, you will see a green tab down along the bottom which says, “Open Chat.” When you open the tab, you’ll be able to join a chat room which is only available to testers. You can also access the chat directly at <a href="https://gitter.im/EGInsiders/Testers?utm_source=share-link&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=share-link">https://gitter.im/EGInsiders/Testers?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link</a> . You will need to join Gitter by using either your Twitter or Github account.</p>
<p>Remember that you can also share feedback on the discussion group by sending email to eginsiders@googlegroups.com or contact me directly by email at <a href="mailto:helpdesk@eduguide.org">helpdesk@eduguide.org</a>. Or, if you are on the Google+ you can contact me through the community there.</p>
<p>The live chat is a great way to post comments or questions while you are on the site testing, or to help other testers as they are running through tests.</p>
