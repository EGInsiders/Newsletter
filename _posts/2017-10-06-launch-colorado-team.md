<h2>Launching the Team</h2>
<p>The goal of this testing exercise is to take a teacher or a group of teachers through the process of launching a core learning path from start to finish. I’ve started the team “Colorado Test Team” on the live site and invited Susan Cirella to launch it. From this point forward, it is up to her to configure the team.</p>
<p>When Susan joins the team she will be taken to the Test Colorado team’s setup page, where she will be prompted to take the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request IT Testing</li>
<li>Select and invite a team captain</li>
<li>Invite coaches to the team</li>
<li>Configure the auto grouping feature</li>
<li>Schedule coaching (not applicable for testing)</li>
<li>Begin working on professional development path</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Subsequent coaches who join the team will be taken into this same page and prompted to make additional changes until all of the steps are complete.</p>
<p>Once the team has been configured, and coaches have been invited, the next big milestone will be to invite students. Coaches will want to:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Create Groups on the Groups page</li>
<li>Use the group join codes to invite students</li>
<li>Begin monitoring students’ progress on the metrics page</li>
</ul>
<h3>Testing Criteria</h3>
<p>All general feedback on this process is welcomed, but I am especially interested in hearing responses to the following questions:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Overall, how easy was it to follow this process?</li>
<li>Once you joined the team, how easy or hard was it to<ol type="a">
<li>Create a new group</li>
<li>Locate the join code for your group</li>
<li>Understand how to use the metrics page</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Notifications and Reminders</h2>
<p>As the team goes through the process of launching, there will be a series of notifications and reminders which will go out. An invitation goes out to each coach that is added to the team. After a few days, a series of reminders will begin to be sent to each coach who hasn’t joined yet. Admin coaches can also manually trigger notification reminders from the “Invite Coaches” section of the team setup page.</p>
<h3>Testing Criteria</h3>
<p>Here are some things to think about as you are receiving the notifications and reminders:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Did you receive a notification?</li>
<li>How helpful was the messaging in each notification? Did it answer the questions you might have about EduGuide, or your role as coach on the team?</li>
<li>As an admin coach, how easy was it to send out the reminder to pending coaches?</li>
</ol>
