I will be publishing news, testing announcements, assignment information, and other resources inside a new website for EduGuide Insiders. It’s in the very early stages. Visitors on the site will need to register as a user tester. Once you have an account, you will be able to access the members-only resources.

Check it out at <a href="http://eduguideinsiders.shepherdhistory.org">http://eduguideinsiders.shepherdhistory.org</a> and let me know what you think. I’m open to suggestions.
