There are several ways in which you can shared feedback, questions, or descriptions of bugs with EduGuide.
<h2>Forum</h2>
A forum has been set aside <a href="http://eduguide.freshdesk.com/support/discussions/3000000297">inside our support site for testers</a>. You can choose from the following topics within the forum:
<ul>
 	<li>Suggested Changes</li>
 	<li>Bugs</li>
 	<li>General Discussions</li>
</ul>
Not only can you share feedback, but the forum has already been populated with a number of bug reports for different features. Feel free to respond to the forum posts with your thoughts.

Before you can view the forum, you will need to register with our support site as a member. You can start an account, or <a href="mailto:jon@eduguide.org">contact me</a> and I’ll make the proper arrangements.
<h2>Widget, Chat and Email</h2>
While you’re on the site, you can submit a question or note about a bug using links in our main navigation.
