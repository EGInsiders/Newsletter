I am looking for volunteers who are available to join a team on our staging site and complete one or two activities inside our path system. As a student, you will be prompted to join a team on our site, and then directed into your first activity in the path. The activities only take a few minutes to complete. You will be able to complete five activities during each session, so you can complete all of them or break them up into separate sessions.<!--more-->
