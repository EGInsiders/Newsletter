In this assignment, I would like to get everybody’s feedback on the process coaches follow when they are joining a team and getting started on the site. Since this is where they learn about our program and get their first impression of our site, it is important that they have a good experience.

The sequence of events include being invited by a coach, joining the team, reviewing the team’s setup page, completing the coaches’ orientation path, and then responding to other coaches’ comments in the path activities, as practice for the moment when students begin interacting with the activities.
<h2>Scenario</h2>
You will receive an invitation to join a team on our staging server as an Admin Coach. After you accept the invitation, you will be guided through the process of joining, responding to the setup steps, and then completing the first activity in the coach orientation. The invitation will also include a link to a form which will collect your feedback.

Mark off the steps in the following checklist as you complete the process. The last question in the form asks you for your feedback, description of bugs, or questions. You can also share feedback using the “Help &amp; Feedback” in the main menu, or by sending email to <a href="mailto:web@eduguide.org">web@eduguide.org</a>.
