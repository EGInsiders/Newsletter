Go to the Groups page underneath your team’s title on the main navigation. Click on “Create a Group,” and then enter in a group name. Your new group will appear under the header “Pending Groups.”
<h2>Copy the Group Join Code</h2>

Click “Invite Members” next to the name of the group you would like students to be added to as they join the team. You will be taken to the group’s Invite code page.

Copy either the join code or the join URL by clicking on the “copy” button. You can also view a full list of group members by clicking on “view list” while you’re on the group’s join code page.
<h3>Distribute the Join code to students</h3>
On the day that you launch the team, share either the URL or the Code with students via email, a handout, or a webpage.
<h2>Ask Students to Join</h2>
Instruct students to join the site by navigating to http://join.eduguide.org and then entering in the join code as they register. Or, if they use the join URL they will automatically be taken to a registration form. After they submit their registration information, they will be confirmed as members of your team and added to your group.
<h2>Student Paths</h2>
Your students’ paths will launch immediately after they join your team. The first activity they work on will ask them to complete a survey and introduce them to the path feature.
