<h1>Test interaction of unrestricted students with Core Learning Path</h1>
<p></p>
<p>I am looking for a few volunteer testers who would be able to join a team on the staging site which has been set up so that when students join they are full members. This means that after joining as a student you will be able to access the team dashboard, but you will also be subscribed to the path. Normally, students are restricted so that they can only see the path interface and their personal dashboards.</p>
<p>As a test student on this time, I am asking you to test the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completing 1-5 activities in the Core Learning path</li>
<li>Viewing your Path Journal</li>
<li>Accessing Glossary terms and viewing your personal glossary</li>
<li>Posting on your personal dashboard</li>
<li>Posting on the team dashboard</li>
<li>Team dashboard notifications</li>
<li>Path comment notifications and reminders</li>
<li>Posting on a goal board</li>
<li>Goal reminders and post notifications</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, watch for anything that you feel the students shouldn’t be able to do. For example, a student shouldn’t be able to remove another user from the team.</p>
<p>You can log issues by using the “Help” tab inside the site, or sending an email message to <a href="mailto:web@eduguide.org">web@eduguide.org</a>. I am also available via live chat during business hours, if you have any questions or see something that you would like to clarify.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ol>
<li>Use the following URL to join the team as a student: http://eduguideinsiders.shepherdhistory.org/2017/10/12/test-interaction-of-unrestricted-students-with-core-learning-path/. If you have registered for the site before, you will need to use a different email address.</li>
<li>Try to do the things that a student would. Complete your path, post on your personal dashboard, write a message on the team board, post on a coach’s dashboard.</li>
<li>Look for ways in which you could mess with the system. Try to write on a board for a fellow student, for example.</li>
</ol>
