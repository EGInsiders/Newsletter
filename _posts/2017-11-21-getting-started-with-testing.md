So, you’re ready to test the EduGuide Platform. Where should you start? Here is a quick guide to the steps you can take as you get started:
<ul>
 	<li><b>Join the <a href="http://eduguideinsiders.shepherdhistory.org">EduGuide Insiders website</a></b>. You will gain access to additional news and resources.</li>
 	<li><b>Join the <a href="https://www.eduguide.org/join/?invitationCode=2375567">EduGuide Insiders testers team on EduGuide.org</a></b>. As you join the testing team, you will be prompted to start a new account on EduGuide. This will give you access to many of EduGuide’s features.</li>
 	<li>Try out the different parts of the site. Besides the team, there will be your personal dashboard, goals, and personal settings page. Try them all out, and then share questions or feedback.</li>
</ul>
Feel free to hunt for bugs, or watch for assignments as I publish them on the site.
